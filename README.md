# Spring Security Tutorial

## Branch 2: Auto-Configuration

A plain Spring Boot Thymeleaf application secured by default

Just adding the spring-boot-starter-security dependency

- Form-based authentication for all endpoints
- Default user (with name user)
- Random password (see console log at startup)
- Default login/logout pages
- Session management
- All endpoints require authentication
- The response includes headers for improved security

Switch to branch 03-basic-auth for HTTP Basic Authentication
